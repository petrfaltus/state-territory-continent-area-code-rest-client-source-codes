# State, territory, continent and area code REST client source codes
Small example console source codes for finding states, territories, continents and area codes. It is the client that communicates using JSONs with my own state, territory, continent and area code REST service.

## Running under Windows
1. clone this repository to your computer
2. build and run the example **Java** code
3. compile and run the example **.NET C#** code
4. run the example **PHP** code

### 1. Cloning to your computer
- install [GIT] on your computer
- clone this repository to your computer by the GIT command
  `git clone https://github.com/petrfaltus/state-territory-continent-area-code-rest-client-source-codes.git`

### 2. The Java client source code
- install [Java JDK] on your computer
- set the OS environment `%JAVA_HOME%` variable (must exist `"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe"`)

#### 2.1. Apache Maven
- install [Apache Maven] on your computer
- add the Maven directory (where the batch `mvn.cmd` locates) to the OS environment `%PATH%` variable

The subdirectory `java-maven` contains prepared Windows batches:
- `01-build.cmd` - cleans, compiles and builds the Maven project
- `02-run.cmd` - runs the built Java archive (JAR)
- `03-clean.cmd` - cleans the Maven project

#### 2.2. Gradle Build Tool
- install [Gradle Build Tool] on your computer
- add the Gradle directory (where the batch `gradle.bat` locates) to the OS environment `%PATH%` variable

The subdirectory `java-gradle` contains prepared Windows batches:
- `01-build.cmd` - cleans, compiles and builds the Gradle project
- `02-run.cmd` - runs the built Java archive (JAR)
- `03-clean.cmd` - cleans the Gradle project

### 3. The .NET C# client source code
- use the `csc.exe` .NET C# compiler that is the part of Microsoft .NET Framework (part of OS)

The subdirectory `csharp` contains prepared Windows batches:
- `01-compile.cmd` - compiles the source code (contains the path definition to the `csc.exe` compiler)
- `02-run.cmd` - runs the Windows executable
- `03-clean.cmd` - deletes the Windows executable

For the JSON serialization and JSON deserialization there is the [Newtonsoft.Json.dll] needed.

### 4. The PHP client source code
- install [PHP] on your computer
- set the OS environment `%PHP_HOME%` variable (must exist `"%PHP_HOME%\php.exe"`)

The subdirectory `php` contains prepared Windows batch:
- `01-run.cmd` - runs the code through the PHP interpreter
